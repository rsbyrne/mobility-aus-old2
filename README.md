See our [special report on the Melbourne COVID-19 outbreak](https://rsbyrne.github.io/mobility-aus/products/meldash.html)

This repository has been established to provide free and easy access to aggregated mobility data products from Facebook and other sources. The data held here is authorised for general release to the public to support research activities related to the COVID-19 epidemic.

The site was established on the 12 May 2020 and will be updated at midnight daily for the foreseeable future.

Don't forget to [***read the guide***](https://rsbyrne.github.io/mobility-aus/guide) for these datas.

## Products

### Facebook Mobility by Local Government Area

These datas, sourced through the Facebook Data For Good program, provide various aggregated metrics
relating to mobility, including a measure of the 'stay-at-home ratio' during the COVID-19 crisis.
The areas in question are given by standard ABS LGA codes; the associated geometries may be freely sourced [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.003~July%202016~Main%20Features~Local%20Government%20Areas%20(LGA)~7).

### Facebook Mobility by ABS Statistical Area (Level 2)

These datas area as above, but aggregated by ABS Statistical Areas (Level 2) rather than local councils.
Statistical Areas may be more convenient than councils for experienced researchers.
The areas in question are given by standard ABS SA2 codes; the associated geometries may be freely sourced [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1270.0.55.001~July%202016~Main%20Features~Statistical%20Area%20Level%202%20(SA2)~10014).

### Facebook Mobility by Postcode
Postcodes are areas defined by Australia Post for the purpose of logistical convenience.
They do not obey any strict statistical conditions in terms of demographics, area, usage, consistency, or compatibility,
so caution is advised when using these aggregations.
Shapefiles are available [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.003July%202016?OpenDocument).
