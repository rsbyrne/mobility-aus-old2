        This chart shows the change in people's behaviour over time in response to lockdown policies and COVID case numbers.
        Facebook movement data for hundreds of thousands of anonymised individuals were aggregated to councils and calendar days
        and analysed to determine the proportion of users who stayed within a few kilometres of their start position
        over a nominal time period. The numbers were then scaled according to the highest (1) and lowest (0) stay-at-home
        values observed for that day of the week (e.g. 'all Mondays') for that council area.
        The councils have been grouped by socioeconomic advantage as defined by the
        <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/censushome.nsf/home/seifa">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a>
        and plotted against case numbers sourced with gratitude from
        <a href="https://covid19data.com.au/">covid19data.com.au</a>
        and
        <a href="https://covidlive.com.au/">covidlive.com.au</a>.
        Values of 1 or higher mean that people are matching or exceeding their highest-recorded mobility,
        while values of 0 or lower mean that people are staying at home as much or more than previously recorded.
        The lower plot shows how the score for each group of councils deviates from the average across all councils on that
        given day: values above 0 indicate that those councils are beating the average,
        while values below 0 show councils that are trailing the average.
        The data are updated daily and go back as far as April when collection began.
